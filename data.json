Six of those who lost their lives were children. \n\nThe French coast guard said more than 50 people were rescued off the Gris-Nez cape, near the town of Boulogne-sur-Mer. Two were said to be in critical condition.   The migrants were reported to be from east Africa.\n\nThe French authorities said the boat was overloaded and only a handful of those on board had life jackets.

He failed to win a direct mandate for the state parliament, but secured a seat because he was top of his party list.\n \nMr H\u00f6cke's party has been designated as right-wing extremist and he has been fined for using a Nazi slogan, although the former history teacher denies knowingly doing so.\n \nThe result gives the far right its first win in a state parliament election since World War Two, although it has little hope of forming a government in Thuringia because other parties are unlikely to work with it.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n \n#Germany #BBCNews",

        "video_description": "Tens of thousands of people have rallied across Israel after the bodies of six hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip were recovered by soldiers, causing national outrage.\n\nProtesters, many clad in Israeli flags, descended on cities including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, demanding that their government reaches a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attacks.\n\nThe protests were largely peaceful but in Tel Aviv crowds broke through police lines, blocking a main highway. The demonstrations came as on of Israel's biggest labour unions, Histadrut, called for a nationwide general strike, demanding that the government reach a deal with Hamas. \n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier that the six bodies were found in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area of southern Gaza.  The hostages were identified as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino.  The IDF said they had been killed shortly before its troops reached them.\n\nNews of the deaths fuelled the protests, with many Israelis accusing their government of not doing enough to secure the release of the remaining hostages.\n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson in Jerusalem.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

It will be rolled out in three separate stages, across the central, southern and northern parts of the strip. During each stage, fighting will pause for three consecutive days between 06:00 and 15:00 local time.\n\nThe agreement comes days after UN officials said a 10-month-old baby had been partially paralysed after contracting Gaza\u2019s first case of polio for 25 years.\n\nThe campaign will be administered by Palestinian health ministry in Gaza in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and UNICEF.\n\nThe WHO is aiming to achieve 90% vaccine coverage across the strip, the level needed to stop transmission of the virus within Gaza.\n\nPolio is highly infectious and is most often spread through sewage and contaminated water. It can cause disfigurement and paralysis and can be fatal. \n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

Gonzalez faces an arrest warrant for questioning over alleged election fraud.\n\nThe lawyer of Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado has been detained. Perkins Rocha also serves as legal adviser for the opposition Vente Venezuela party.\n\nHe is the latest person with links to the opposition to be seized in the aftermath of last month's presidential election.\n\nThe government of Maduro has detained more than 2,400 people over the past month, creating what the UN has called \"a climate of fear\".\n \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n\n#Venezuela #Election #BBCNews",

Congress leaders have not responded. The remarks have gone viral on social media, and this is not the first time Congress MLAs have targeted Ranaut, who represents the Mandi constituency.

Initially an eight-day mission, the trip has been extended to early 2025. The spacecraft faced thruster malfunctions and propellant valve failures. NASA has now decided that the astronauts will return to Earth with SpaceX's Crew 9 mission in February 2025, while the Starliner will return uncrewed. The astronauts have reported strange noises from the spacecraft and face health issues due to their prolonged stay.\n\n #nasa #sunitawilliams #butchwilmore #boeingstarliner #spacex #iss #spacemission\n\nSubscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.\n\nAll you need to do is PRESS THE BELL ICON next to the Subscribe button!\n\nIndia Today TV is India's leading English News Channel.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court had earlier directed the CBFC to consider the representation from Sikh groups in Jabalpur.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his independent campaign for president Friday and endorsed Donald Trump, a late-stage shakeup of the presidential race that could give the former president a modest boost from Kennedy\u2019s supporters.\n\nKennedy said his internal polls had shown that his presence in the race would hurt Trump and help Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, though recent public polls don\u2019t provide a clear indication that he is having an outsize impact on support for either major-party candidate.\n\n#live #donaldtrump #arizona #robertfkennedy #trumprally #trumpspeech #uselections2024 #trumpnewslive #usnewslive  #donaldtrumpnews #trumplive #englishnews \n\nTimes Now - Times Now News channel examines news with in-depth analysis.

The bill mandates the death penalty for rape convicts if the victim dies as a result of the assault and imposes longer prison terms for disclosing victims' identities. It also enforces life imprisonment for acid attacks. A special Aparajita Task Force will be established to ensure rapid justice, with convicts expected to be sentenced within two days of the preliminary report. In a fiery speech, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee criticized Prime Minister Modi, accusing him of failing to protect India's women.\n\n#westbengal #aparajita #assembly #mamatabanerjee #pmmodi #tmc #kolkatahorror #kolkatadoctor #kolkatarapecase #rgkar #topnews #mirrornow\nSUBSCRIBE NOW for more such videos \u25bahttp://bit.ly/2LesD8T\n\nFor More Updates \u25ba http://www.mirrornownews.com\nLike us on Facebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Twitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Instagram \u25ba https://www.instagram.com/mirrornow_in/",

It is a music or production quality in which elements usually regarded as imperfections of a recording or performance are audible, are deliberately used as aesthetic choice. Some of these sounds are Vinyl Crackles, Pitch bending etc. These songs are very good for focus playlists or Study playlists. \n\nMusic Label - Sony Music Entertainment India Pvt.

I know this isn\u2019t the most algorithm-optimized, easy to consume, but I do feel that we need more stories like this more than the mindless YouTube challenge content. So I do hope it resonates with you and that it can, as I say in the video, build a bridge or plant a seed for empathy within us.

If you have already purchased this holiday, you're already good to go :) if you'd like a chance to join me, you know where to go! \u26a1\ufe0f \u26a1\ufe0f \u26a1\ufe0f \n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort\n\nWhen it comes to what happened at the end.. It really shook me, we felt with the local team that we'd really prepared the best we could but sometimes unexpected problems like this one can happen. We've checked several times and everyone there is fine, they were really just looking for me. Nothing like this had really happened before even though I have experience traveling to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania and I understand that there are things you can and cannot do. I went home after this trip to mentally recuperate and recharge.\n\n//\n\n\u2708 Book an Adventure: https://travel.yestheory.com/\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n\u207a Seek Discomfort: https://www.youtube.com/seekdiscomfort\n\ud83d\udcdd Follow Matt\u2019s Newsletter: http://yestheory.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram -  https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter - https://twitter.com/yestheory\n\ud83c\udfac  Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/yestheory/\n\n\u262e\ufe0f If you want to join the Yes Fam Facebook group which is 100,000+ of our most engaged and badass community members, you can apply here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/yesfam/\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 HOW WE MAKE OUR VIDEOS\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Where we find our music:\n1- Epidemic Sound.

Folklore says that this creature is drawn to fire, furious with mankind for stealing it from them. After meeting with locals who have seen this Bigfoot coming out of the forest, the team knows they must construct a trap that utilizes fire in an attempt to capture it. The hunt turns into a nightmare when the team realizes their sound guy is missing -- likely TAKEN by the Fire Ape. In an attempt to distract the beast and save their lost crew member, the team sets off dozens of fireworks in the middle of the woods.

The team -- local paranormal investigator Jereme Leonard, former FBI agent Ben Hansen, and psychic medium Sarah Lemos -- investigate a mysterious mist they believe to be Ada LeBoeuf. Her spirit shapeshifts into a \u201cMouthless Lady\u201d near the town's lake, and the team learns that her hauntings have spread throughout the rest of St. Mary Parish. During a heart-pounding investigation, the team captures a face in mist whom they believe is Ada herself. After talking with her spirit through the team's REM Pod, Ada clears her name as her husband's murderer. \n\nThe Streaming Home of Paranormal on discovery+: https://www.discoveryplus.com/?genre=paranormal-unexplained\nLike Travel Channel on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TravelChannel/\nFollow Travel Channel on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/travelchannel/\nFollow Travel Channel on Twitter: https://twitter.com/travelchannel\nFollow Travel Channel on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@travelchannel\nVisit Travel Channel: http://www.travelchannel.com",

He begins with a first-hand look at the preserving and aging process of Rome\u2019s crowning jewel: pecorino Romano cheese. He is granted access into the heavily-guarded limestone caves that house the Brunelli family\u2019s massive cheese fortune and takes a bite extracted from the center of an aging wheel. Then, it\u2019s off to Pizzeria Ostiense for some of Rome's paper-thin style pizzas topped with anchovy sauce and puntarelle, buffalo mozzarella and red sauce, and peas, mushroom, and sausage.

        "video_description": "Paranormal investigator Dave Schrader, psychic medium Cindy Kaza, and equipment expert Shane Pittman visit the haunted Morris-Jumel Mansion in New York City -- one of Hans Holzer\u2019s most famous cases. In 1964, Holzer communicated with Stephen Jumel, a man who was supposedly killed by his wife Eliza. Reopening the case, the team suspects a darker presence is now in the home. As they communicate with Eliza, they encounter a terrifying presence, suggesting the mansion\u2019s true hauntings might be more complex and sinister than they originally thought.\n\nParanormal investigator Dave Schrader, psychic medium Cindy Kaza, equipment expert Shane Pittman and researcher Gabe Roth investigate terrifyingly true hauntings from the recently discovered case files of America's first ghost hunter, Dr. Hans Holzer. Recognized as the \"\"father of the paranormal,\"\" Holzer's four-decades-long exploration into disturbing hauntings like the Amityville Horror house spawned legions of supernatural enthusiasts, more than 120 books and even inspired Dan Aykroyd to write Ghostbusters. For the first time ever, Holzer's daughter, Alexandra Holzer, reopens her father's most captivating case files -- along with thousands of his documents, letters, photographs and hours of chilling audio-visual recordings from as early as the 1950s. Equipped with this treasure trove of paranormal knowledge and state-of-the-art technology, the team compares their findings with Holzer's to see if their modern research sheds new light on these half-century-old investigations.\n#Travelchannel #TheHolzerFiles #Ghost \n\nThe Streaming Home of Paranormal on discovery+: https://www.discoveryplus.com/?genre=paranormal-unexplained\nLike Travel Channel on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TravelChannel/\nFollow Travel Channel on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/travelchannel/\nFollow Travel Channel on Twitter: https://twitter.com/travelchannel\nFollow Travel Channel on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@travelchannel\nVisit Travel Channel: http://www.travelchannel.com\n\nDark Secrets of NYC\u2019s Morris-Jumel Mansion - Full Episode Recap | The Holzer Files | Travel Channel\nhttps://youtu.be/JWKCBZJAAhs",

In 1963, Holzer recorded ghostly events at the Peck House, tied to Ladi Peck, a girl who died in a fire in 1884. Although a portrait seemed to calm her spirit in 1985, the team now finds similar activity at the nearby Knapp House. As the team investigates, they face chilling encounters: water mysteriously seeping from the ceiling, unseen forces grabbing their necks, and a sinister woman with blackened teeth.\n\nParanormal investigator Dave Schrader, psychic medium Cindy Kaza, equipment expert Shane Pittman and researcher Gabe Roth investigate terrifyingly true hauntings from the recently discovered case files of America's first ghost hunter, Dr. Hans Holzer. Recognized as the \"\"father of the paranormal,\"\" Holzer's four-decades-long exploration into disturbing hauntings like the Amityville Horror house spawned legions of supernatural enthusiasts, more than 120 books and even inspired Dan Aykroyd to write Ghostbusters. For the first time ever, Holzer's daughter, Alexandra Holzer, reopens her father's most captivating case files -- along with thousands of his documents, letters, photographs and hours of chilling audio-visual recordings from as early as the 1950s. Equipped with this treasure trove of paranormal knowledge and state-of-the-art technology, the team compares their findings with Holzer's to see if their modern research sheds new light on these half-century-old investigations.\n#Travelchannel #TheHolzerFiles #Ghost \n\nThe Streaming Home of Paranormal on discovery+: https://www.discoveryplus.com/?genre=paranormal-unexplained\nLike Travel Channel on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TravelChannel/\nFollow Travel Channel on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/travelchannel/\nFollow Travel Channel on Twitter: https://twitter.com/travelchannel\nFollow Travel Channel on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@travelchannel\nVisit Travel Channel: http://www.travelchannel.com\n\nReopening CHILLING 50-Year-Old Haunting - Full Episode Recap | The Holzer Files | Travel Channel\nhttps://youtu.be/5n0SE_LdLS4",

It is visible from the church square behind the building. At the time, the parish of Cagnes had 1,200 souls.\n\nTHE HIDDEN VILLAGES THAT NOBODY WANTS TO SHOW - A TREASURE ON FRENCH RIVIERA\n\nIn the church, you can admire some religious paintings from the 18th century, including the canvas that adorns the high altar and represents the handing over of the keys to Saint-Pierre.\nThe paintings of the Stations of the Cross, produced by the painter Charles Barkev on the occasion of the 2000 Jubilee, offer the particularity of representing Cagnois from Haut-de-Cagnes who agreed to pose to illustrate the Passion of Christ.\n\nWhen \"The Rounded Hill\"...\n\u201cCagnes\u201d is a name of Ligurian origin which means \u201cinhabited place on a rounded hill\u201d.\n\nThis rocky outcrop, which culminates at 91 meters above sea level, offered our ancestors an ideal surveillance and defense position, near a river and good land.\n\nThis place was first occupied by the Celto-Ligurians and then by the Gallo-Romans.\n\nWhen Provence united with France in 1483, Cagnes became a border town on the only road leading to France from the States of Savoy.\n\nFrom the 16th century, this border zone which entered into a cycle of great European wars was often looted and sacked.\n\n\nThe reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV bring back wars and multiple invasions of the border area.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, in 1790, Cagnes still had only 1,388 inhabitants, most of them peasants who lived from the cultivation of vines, olive trees, hemp, citrus fruits and early vegetables.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, when Renoir came to settle in our city, from 1903 to his death in 1919, Cagnes was the capital of the canton with around 3,000 inhabitants.\nAttracted by the celebrity of the Impressionist master, many painters who loved the Mediterranean light came to settle in this picturesque town which is nicknamed \"The Montmartre of the C\u00f4te d'Azur\", and which attracts celebrities from the world of arts and entertainment until the 1960s.\n\nAmong the most famous, stayed or lived in Haut-de-Cagnes, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Chaim Soutine, Foujita, Yves Klein, Georges Simenon (at 98, Mont\u00e9e de la Bourgade), Mouloudji (singer poet and composer), Suzy Solidor (singer and cabaret director), Georges Ulmer and Brigitte Bardot\u2026\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\u25b6 \ufe0eSUBSCRIBE!

Church, ramparts, chapels, aqueduct, fountains, alliances of water and stone, pastel tones of tiles and tuff shape a homogeneous and lively architectural ensemble. The gentle way of life that emerges naturally encourages us to respect and enhance this place, to discover it and protect it. The work of the land, perpetrated for centuries, is the link between the history and the future of the village.\n\nAuthentic and lively\n\nToday, Moustiers has around 700 inhabitants. The heart of its economy revolves around tourism and the earthenware tradition. The reception capacity in the town is significant. In addition to 750 camping pitches and a holiday village, 130 hotel rooms in the village centre or on the outskirts, around twenty g\u00eetes and guest rooms and more than 50 furnished accommodations, it is easy to discover the local wonders beyond a fleeting crossing. The various services will satisfy all desires and all budgets.\n\nOn the commercial side, the shops of artists and craftsmen rub shoulders with local services.\n\nOn the food side, around twenty restaurants satisfy gourmets and gourmands, lovers of refined gastronomy, brasseries or local cuisine.\n\nA village anchored in the Verdon Regional Natural Park and the Haute-Provence Geopark.\n\nMoustiers-Sainte-Marie is part of the Verdon Regional Natural Park, spanning the two departments of Var and Alpes de Haute Provence, which extends over 46 municipalities and includes seven large landscape areas. This diversity of ecosystems gives the park a rich and varied natural heritage: vultures, bats, chamois, roe deer and endemic flora. The headquarters of the Verdon Regional Natural Park is located in the municipality of Moustiers.\nwww.parcduverdon.fr\n\nGorges du Verdon\n\nMoustiers is also located in the territory of the UNESCO Haute-Provence Geopark.

Many natural and geological sites allow you to discover the last 300 million years of Earth's history.\nwww.geoparchauteprovence.com\n\nThe mountains rock The cliffs on which the village is built and those dominating it formed natural lines of defense, but Moustiers also protected itself behind ramparts as for many villages, built in the Middle Ages.\n\nPierre de Pratis, commendatory prior, ordered in 1336 the enlargement of the church; the axis of the nave was not respected and we do not know if the prior wanted to incline the choir in the direction of Jerusalem or recall the position of the head of Christ on the cross. The current altar is a fourth century sarcophagus in white marble representing the passage of the Red Sea.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\u25b6 \ufe0eSUBSCRIBE!

Characterised by its canals and beautiful half-timbered houses, this region also stands out for its succulent cuisine that perfectly blends French cuisine with traditional German recipes. If you are planning a getaway to the east of France, at Civitatis we explain what to see in Alsace.\n\n\n1 - Colmar is the quintessential Alsatian village. Its romantic canals attract hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. These visitors also come in search of the colourful, typically Alsatian houses, which are decorated in bright pastel colours.\n\nPrecisely because of its network of canals, anyone who visits Colmar cannot miss the district of La Petite Venise or Little Venice. Walking through this area will surely make you feel like you are in a film. And no wonder, since the directors of the feature film Beauty and the Beast were inspired by the architecture of Colmar and other nearby towns to recreate the fictional village in which the animated film takes place.\n\nWalt Disney himself had French ancestry \u2013 his roots can be traced back to the tiny dairy town of Isigny-sur-Mer in Normandy, where his ancestors became the Lords d\u2019Isigny, before moving to England and anglicising it to Disney. And France\u2019s Rococo interiors and romantic ch\u00e2teaux have inspired many a Disney set. So when it came to creating the 1991 animated version of Beauty and the Beast, the producers could think of no better setting for Belle\u2019s home than Alsace.\n\nThe streets Belle calls home in the movie are almost identical to some of those seen in Colmar, Riquewihr and Ribeauvill\u00e9, all within a one-hour drive of the region\u2019s main city, Strasbourg. She is portrayed as a conflicted outsider who longs to break free from the beautiful, yet predictable, small town she lives in \u2013 but when her plans are unexpectedly sidelined and she finds herself trapped in the ch\u00e2teau of a formidable beast, she gets a little more adventure than she\u2019d bargained for.\n\n2 - Stroll through the cobbled streets of Eguisheim, listed among the Most Beautiful Villages in France. A charming little village, typically Alsatian, with its old houses with pointed roofs, bright colours and half-timbered fa\u00e7ades. \"\n\nEguisheim is an essential stop during your stay in Alsace!\n\nLocated at the southern exit of Colmar, Eguisheim has been classified as one of the \"Most Beautiful Villages in France\" since 2003 and won the title of \"Favorite Village of the French\" in 2013 during the France 2 show presented by St\u00e9phane Bern.\n\nThis medieval village is popular for its modest size, its unique architecture, its profusion of flowers in the summer, but also for its authentic charm during Christmas time when many activities are offered around the Christmas market.\n\nEguisheim takes its claim to fame from its architectural ensemble, preserved from the ravages of history and intelligently preserved.\nBuilt around its castle, this medieval city unfolds in concentric circles. In this original village, you will discover fountains, courtyards and a church housing a \"Vierge Ouvrante\" from the 13th century.\n\nIt will be good to stroll along the alleys and admire the colorful palette of the houses where you can decipher the very old inscriptions on the door lintels.\n\nIn addition, from Colmar you can visit the nearby German city of Freiburg im Breisgau, considered the gateway to the Black Forest in Germany.\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nSwitzerland Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyVbsU6txuAApbjpZleNzmFbb31drSnCV\n\nItaly Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyVbsU6txuADJ5D69HR1gSdCjFF61F1Lp\n\nFrance Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyVbsU6txuAD0Scg426hKleLYMbNImJTK\n\nMonaco Playlist : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyVbsU6txuACPpP7CivhOv-u2vFVd02Vl\n\nGermany Playlist : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyVbsU6txuADZPr0BPm2YsRc4o4rX7anj\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\u25b6 \ufe0eSUBSCRIBE!

Immerse yourself in the heart of the authenticity of Grimaud and go back the centuries along the flowery paths.\n\nGrimaud attracts tourists from all over the world due to its authentic charm, local gastronomy and proximity to popular destinations such as Saint-Tropez.\n\nThe monuments of Grimaud make you feel the past but not only... The cobbled streets, the stone walls tell stories that they are perhaps the last to know. It resonates with the secrets of Grimaud.\n\nLose yourself in the alleys, a thousand stories have happened there. It's up to you to imagine them.\n\nGrimaud, in the Gulf of Saint-Tropez, is a village proudly displaying the colors of Provence. A Provence that is part of a medieval atmosphere, with its houses, its alleys, its Castle... The latter is the best known of the monuments in Grimaud, but did you know that it was far from being the only heritage building?\n\nWhen summer arrives, it brings with it the blooming bougainvillea.\n\nAnd what a wonder! The buildings of the old village are then adorned with a tailor-made purple dress to decorate the doors and windows of the houses.\n\nSome bougainvilleas even climb a whole section of the facade. They are looking for the sun, to sunbathe every time!\n\nIt is a beautiful shrub that is often found in the Mediterranean, it is rare to find it in colder regions because it does not resist frost (a bit like the inhabitants of the south, it must be admitted).\n\nA village flowered by its inhabitants\nEvery year, every season, the inhabitants of the old village delight us with their plantations which mingle, gently, with the houses, the alleys.\n\nWe nicknamed them among ourselves: \u201cthe village gardeners\u201d.\n\nIt is impossible to miss the bougainvilleas during your visit. The best time to discover them is between the end of May/July. They may bloom again after summer as well.\n\nFind the \"bougainvillea walk\" where around thirty shrubs are referenced and admire them in the alleys of Grimaud.\n\nA village blessed by the gods\nThe heart of the perched village, wonderfully restored, has kept all its authenticity: cobbled streets, facades with vaulted arcades, pastel windows with flowery shutters, squares with bougainvillea essences. Unmissable, the discovery tour of the village, its churches and chapels bears witness to a rich historical past, traces of which can be found in the Museum of Popular Arts and Traditions.\n\nWhen the roads shaded by pine trees give way to large expanses of vines. When those winding roads end up guiding you over steep heights. When with your fingertips you feel these old stones full of history. The smell of bougainvillea scratches my nose, I walk from cobblestone to cobblestone, I follow these vaulted arcades. Grimaud, the radiant, Grimaud the fragrant. Labyrinthine streets, graceful houses, I discover Grimaud, the discreet one, Grimaud the secret alcove. Time has left its mark on these villages which have managed to keep their heritage without distorting it. Medieval images take shape, we happily invent a life for ourselves. The magic happens because authenticity remains preserved. If there are three Proven\u00e7al villages to visit in the Gulf of Saint Tropez, it\u2019s these three!\n\n#grimaud #France #Provence #travel #frenchvillage #medievalvillage #BeautifulVillage",

Among the main attractions are the Church of Santa Maria Assunta, the picturesque alleys and the excellent local cuisine.\n\nIt's hard to find a better subject for a photographer: Positano is a postcard from every angle.\nOnce a peaceful fishing village, it is one of the most fashionable destinations for famous people and travelers from around the world. It began to attract a large share of tourists in the 1950s, especially after John Steinbeck published an essay about this place in May 1953 where he wrote: \u201cPositano affects us deeply. It\u2019s a dream place that doesn\u2019t seem real to you while you\u2019re there and it becomes nostalgically real when you leave.\u201d\n\nThe origins of this charming place are mixed between history and legend. As in the past, myths are the remedy for the lack of actual data: one of them attributes the founding of Positano to Poseidon, the god of the sea, for the love of the nymph Pasitea.\n\nIt is an almost impossible city: on the slopes of the Lattari Mountains, it forms a colorful landscape that overlooks the Mediterranean Sea with a view that extends to the sea, the islands and the other centers of the Costiera Amalfitana.\n\nPositano itself is a sight to visit: the alleys are narrow passages between houses and steep staircases that intersect the alleys. Only one road crosses the town, Viale Pasitea, the rest of the village is only accessible on foot, between shops, art galleries, artisan workshops, restaurants, cafes and bougainvillea waterfalls.\n\nPositano\nMarina Grande beach is the most famous and frequented and offers one of the most beautiful panoramas of the characteristic cascade of colorful houses. A panoramic path \u2013 which runs along the sea and the Saracen watchtowers \u2013 leads to Fornillo beach, for those who prefer less crowded places.\n\nPearl of the Amalfi Coast in southern Italy, Positano clings to the rocks overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. Between Sorrento and Amalfi, Positano is the most touristy village on the Italian coast south of Naples. Historically linked to the Republic of Amalfi, Positano owes its wealth to maritime trade with the Near and Middle East in the 16th century.\nFrom the 20th century, thanks to its idyllic location, the village became a vacation spot for the wealthy and artists, a symbol of la dolce vita made in Italy. Today luxury villas, hotels, fashion stores pile up in a crowded historic center, but the charm of Positano, its beaches and its splendid viewpoints, still operates. Treat yourself to an Italian vacation between sea and mountains.\n\nAccording to legend, Neptune, the god of the sea in Roman mythology, built this little corner of paradise in homage to a nymph with whom he was madly in love.\n\nMoreover, Positano has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997!\n\nTherefore, I advise you to take a short day to visit Positano during your stay on the Amalfi Coast. The opportunity to make a stop between Sorrento and Amalfi, for example. If possible, avoid leaving during the summer: choose a trip out of season. Particularly in spring (April and May) and at the beginning of autumn (October).\n\nI thank you for accompanying me on this journey, I hope you like it, and I hope to see you again soon, I wish you blessed days and much love, with great respect I send you many leaps, with love Sebastian \ud83e\udd17\u2764\ufe0f\n\n#positano #amalfi #italy #travel #beautifulplaces #beautifulvillage",

This charming village is renowned for its natural beauty and authentic medieval village atmosphere. Here are some of the most important information about Eze:\n\n1. **History and Architecture**:\n - Eze has a long history, dating back to the Roman period, and was first mentioned in documents in the 10th century.\n - The village retains many of its medieval features, with narrow cobbled streets, stone houses and monumental gates.\n - In the center of the village are the ruins of a medieval castle, built in the 12th century and destroyed in the 18th century.\n\n2. **Jardin Exotique d'Eze**:\n - It is an exotic garden located on the top of the hill, around the ruins of the castle. The garden offers an impressive collection of cacti and other succulents, as well as spectacular panoramas of the C\u00f4te d'Azur and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n3. **Overview**:\n - Due to its elevated position, approximately 427 meters above sea level, Eze offers some of the most spectacular views of the region. From the top of the hill, visitors can see from Saint-Tropez to the Italian border on clear days.\n\n4. **Church of Notre-Dame de l'Assomption**:\n - The baroque church of Eze, built in the 18th century, is another point of attraction. It is famous for its distinctive bell tower and elegant interior.\n\n5. **Famous Perfumes**:\n - Eze is also known for its artisanal perfumeries such as Fragonard and Galimard. Visitors can take guided tours to learn about the perfume-making process and purchase products directly from the source.\n\n6. **Accessibility**:\n - Eze is only a few kilometers from Nice and Monaco, easily accessible by car, bus or train. The coastal road between Nice and Eze, known as the Moyenne Corniche, offers breathtaking views and is an attraction in itself.\n\n7. **Culture and Events**:\n - Throughout the year, Eze hosts various cultural events, including music and art festivals. The bohemian atmosphere and local traditions attract both tourists and artists from around the world.\n\n\nMy take is that Eze, a medieval village perched on a rocky hill above the Mediterranean Sea, is a place where time seems to have stood still. Its narrow and winding cobbled streets wind through old stone houses adorned with colorful flowers and lush greenery. Floral fragrances mingle with the salty sea breeze, creating an enchanting aroma that invites visitors to stop and take a deep breath.\n\nThe ruins of the medieval castle watch from above, offering a panoramic view of the entire C\u00f4te d'Azur, from where you can see how the sun is reflected in the blue waves of the sea. The Jardin Exotique d'Eze, with its unusual cacti and succulent plants, stretches out like a secret garden, where every corner hides a new botanical discovery and another breathtaking view.\n\nI thank you from the bottom of my heart for accompanying me to this wonderful fairy-tale village, we will meet again soon in another magical place, I love you and send you greetings, I wish for peace all over the world, with respect and friendship, Sebastian \ud83e\udd17\n\n#Eze #France #Provence #travel #frenchvillage #medievalvillage #BeautifulVillage",

The name of the city originated from the medieval Latin name of the region \u201csiva arboris belli\u201d (The wood of the tree of war).\n\nTrulli Houses\nThe trulli are drystone dwellings with conical roofs. A typical trullo has thick walls and is either round-shaped or square. In Alberobello most of the trulli are square-shaped.\n\n\n\nUsually a trullo is a single-storey small building. It is technically hard to construct a multi-storey trullo. There are only few two-storey trulli in the town. The second floor in these constructions is made of wood, but this happens rarely. It is easier and more practical to construct several small trulli than a big one.\n\nThat is why big families in Alberobello were living not in one single trullo, but rather in trulli groups. Big families could have a group of dozen trulli constructed next to each other. The interior of a trulli is mainly made from wood. The roofs are not painted, but the walls are traditionally painted white.\n\nTrullo is a rural building type. It was meant to serve as field shelters and storehouses. Alberobello is a unique case where they became the main lodgment for the local population.\n\nDiscover Alberobello\nAlberobello is a small Italian town like any other at a first glance. The streets are narrow and hilly, houses are white, the weather is pleasant and life is slow.\n\nAlberobello trulli\nBut if you take a closer look to some of the houses, you will think you landed in a fantasy book. Small houses with conical roofs are dotted everywhere around you.\n\nTrulli History\nThe history behind Alberobello is of course connected with money and cunning Italian aristocrats.\n\nWhen in the 14th century the previously uninhibited area became under the control of the Count of Conversano, he and his successors decided not to construct permanent dwellings here for their peasants, as far as the taxes for the lands with no permanent settlements were lower, than those with officially recognized towns. In order to pay small taxes Alberobello was supposed to be classified as an uninhabited area. For this reason trulli in Alberobello were being constructed in a specific way.\n\nTrulli were being constructed from roughly worked limestone, because this material could be easily dismantled and later reused for reconstruction of the dwellings. Because of the jiggery-pokery of their landlord the inhabitants of Alberobello have already been living in trulli for several centuries.\n\nUp to the mid 17th century there were only several dozen trulli in the area, but during the following century the population of the town rapidly increased.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century the town had a population of 3,500 inhabitants. In 1797 Alberobello was finally granted a status of a town, but up to that date its population was living in trulli, which could be easily and quickly disassembled if it was necessary.\n\nToday, AlberobelIo is one of the best preserved historical urban areas of this type in Europe. The historical value of the town increases because the Alberobello trulli are still serving as houses for the local population.\n\nI thank you for watching, please excuse my breathing, I don't do it on purpose, health problems \u2639\ufe0f , see you soon in other unique places, be blessed, I love you all, peace to all, with respect , Sebastian\n\n\n\n#alberobello #italy #travel #beautifulplaces #beautifulvillage",

The village attracts 13 times more visitors than inhabitants, which demonstrates a real problem to manage, mainly for the locals, who cannot live peacefully in their village. However, until 1960, it was a haven of peace, accessible only by boat and of which no one knew the value and the beauty of the surroundings, except its inhabitants. It was the construction of the road that kick-started tourism. Then, in 1997, Hallstatt was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThere is a replica of Hallstatt village in Asia, 100% identical. In 2012, a residential and tourist complex called \"Hallstatt China\" was inaugurated in Huizhou City, Guangdong Province, China. This replica is a faithful interpretation of the architecture and picturesque landscape of the Austrian village of Hallstatt.\n\nHallstatt is a historic village located in the Austrian region of Salzkammergut, about 78 km from Salzburg. Surrounded by mountains and located on the shores of Lake Hallstatt (Hallst\u00e4ttersee in German), the village is thus at the center of a magical environment in all seasons.\n\nHowever, it all really started when the village was proclaimed \"the most Instagrammable village in the world\" in Asia and it was reproduced identically in China, in Huizhou, in 2012. China is known for its many counterfeits of all kinds, including textiles, but we had never seen an entire village reproduced before. Although the inauguration ceremony took place in the presence of a delegation from the Austrian village, many inhabitants were indignant at this copy, having not been made aware of such a project.\n\nThis craze for the historic town has been even more poisoned since it seems that the creators of Frozen took the Austrian village as a model to create the fictitious town of Arendelle (many rumors about this, in itself we don't know not what it is). Considering the excitement that both installments of the Disney franchise have garnered, it's hard not to want to head to the hypothetical place of inspiration for your favorite cartoon.\n\nThe beauty of the Alpine landscape - with its high pastures used for the mountain pastures of sheep and cattle since prehistoric times during the process of transhumance which, even today, gives the communities of the valley the right of access to specific high-altitude grazing areas - was \"discovered\" at the beginning of the 19th century by writers such as the novelist Adalbert Stifler, the poet dramatist Franz Grillparzer and most of the renowned painters of the Biedermeier school. With the increase in the number of tourists, hotels and salt water baths have developed to accommodate visitors.\n\nThe landscape is exceptional, forming a set of great scientific interest and immense natural power that has played a fundamental role in the history of man, as evidenced by the imprint of the miners-farmers over the centuries, while mining transformed the interior of the mountain and that artists and writers described its harmony and beauty.\n\nIn conclusion, Hallstatt's worldwide popularity is fueled by its natural beauty, cultural and historical richness, as well as media exposure and social media impact.\n\n\n#hallstatt #austria #travel #beautiful #beautifulvillage #beautifulplace",

Traditionally founded around 753 BC, Rome became the epicenter of the Roman Republic and then the Roman Empire, reaching its peak under Augustus and Trajan. With an advanced legal system, grand architecture, and lasting influences in art and literature, Rome was the engine of early Western civilization. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. it marked the end of an era, but its legacy continues to inspire and fascinate today, attracting millions of visitors each year.\n\nIn the heart of the Italian peninsula, guarded by the river Tiber, lies one of the most emblematic and historic metropolises of the world - Rome. With a history spanning more than two millennia, this magnificent city is a veritable open-air museum, where every corner preserves the story of its ancient glory and the cultural influences that shaped Western civilization.\n\nThe Colosseum, a symbol of Rome and its ancient empire, proudly raised its grandiose architecture, reminding us of the bloody spectacles of gladiators and the magnificence of Roman engineering. Nearby, the Roman Forum, the center of public and political life in ancient times, still impresses with its majestic ruins and grand columns that bore witness to imperial glory.\n\nBut Rome is not just a museum of antiquity; it is also home to the most important center of Christianity, the Vatican. Here, in St. Peter's Square, guarded by the famous basilica, pilgrims gather to worship the tomb of St. Peter and to admire the masterpieces of Michelangelo and other masters of Renaissance art.\n\nIn addition to its historical monuments, Rome is also a city of contemporary art and culture. Its narrow streets and picturesque squares hide architectural gems, art museums, galleries and traditional restaurants where you can enjoy authentic Italian cuisine.\n\nBut amidst its bustle and grandeur, Rome retains its charm and intimacy. Every corner hides a story, and every step along its cobbled streets takes you back in time, offering a captivating journey through history, art and culture.\n\nRome is not just a city, it is an unforgettable experience, a journey through time and space, where every stone has something to say and every moment is full of emotion and learning. It is the place where the past meets the present, and its beauty and grandeur immortalize the legends and stories that have made Rome the \"Eternal City\".\n\nIf you love history, art and a vibrant atmosphere, Rome is the perfect destination for you! Arm yourself with a comfortable pair of shoes and explore the cobbled streets steeped in history. Delight your senses with delicious Italian gastronomy and enjoy a delicious gelato in the picturesque streets. Rome is a city that will conquer you with its eternal charm!  This is my advice for those who want to visit Rome, with much love and respect, Sebastian \u2764\ufe0f \ud83e\udd17 \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n00:00 Intro \n03:45 Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II\n05:20 Church of Santa Maria di Loreto \n06:31 Fontana di Trevi\n08:57 Columna de Marco Aurelio\n09:33 Il Tempio di Adriano \n12:47 Italian pasta\n13:26 Panteon de Roma\n18:01 Church of Santa Maria Maddalena\n21:07 Walking the streets of Rome \n23:00 Parliament Square\n24:33 Basilica dei Santi Ambrogio e Carlo al Corso\n27:12 Plaza del P\u00f3polo\n29:46 Piazza di Spagna\n33:18 Columna de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n\n35:39 Beautiful Italian apartment \n38:57 The End\n\n\n#rome #italy #europe #travel",

The city has no roads, only canals, including the Grand Canal, lined with Gothic and Renaissance palaces. In the center, St. Mark's Square is home to St. Mark's Basilica, covered in Byzantine mosaics, and St. Mark's Campanile, with views of the red roofs of Venice.\n\nVenice is a unique and historic city known for its many attractions and distinctive features. Here are some highlights about Venice:\n\nCanals: Venice is famous for its unique network of canals, which serve as the city's main transportation arteries. The canals are crossed by hundreds of bridges, and the main waterway is the Grand Canal, which runs through the city in the shape of an \"S\".\n\nArchitecture: The city is decorated with numerous palaces, churches and impressive historical buildings. Its Gothic and Renaissance architecture is remarkable and was influenced by the wealth and cultural and economic importance of the city in its heyday.\n\nThe gondolas of Venice are iconic symbols of the city and are often associated with romance and elegance. The gondola was invented around the 11th century and was the main form of transport in Venice for centuries. Originally, gondolas were decorated in bright and rich colors, but the rules were changed in the 16th century to prevent hostile competition between gondola owners.\n\nPiazza San Marco: This iconic square is the center of social and cultural life in Venice. Famous attractions such as San Marco Basilica, the Doge's Palace and the Clock Tower are located here. Piazza San Marco is often described as \"the dining room of Europe\".\n\nVenice Carnival: Venice Carnival is one of the most famous carnival festivals in the world. The event is celebrated before Easter and attracts tourists from all over the world with elaborate masks, extravagant costumes and festive events.\n\nThe problem of flooding: Venice is facing a serious problem of flooding due to rising sea levels and the gradual sinking of the city. The MOSE (Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico) project was initiated to protect the city against flooding, consisting of mobile barriers that can be erected to close the entrances to the lagoon in case of high tide.\n\nThese are just some of the highlights about Venice, a city that continues to fascinate and attract millions of visitors every year.\n\nThe history of Venice is a fascinating and long one, spanning more than 1000 years. Here is a brief overview of the history of this unique city:\n\nThe beginnings: The origin of Venice can be traced back to the late Roman Empire, when people began to take refuge in the islands in the lagoon to escape the barbarian invasions.

The absence of vehicles, except those of the residents, makes it possible to the visitors to walk in this village in all peace to admire its streets in calades, its arched passages, its houses with the carved pediments, signatures of the Templars.\n\nThe amateurs of the past will be able to carry their glances on the ruins of the two castles whose this village bears its name, of churches and vaults, laundrettes, and, from the top of view-point, the sight on the throats and the Midsummer\u2019s Day vault.

I am always fascinated by the landscapes of this route and the landscapes of this country. So I decided to share these wonderful landscapes with you. I hope you enjoy . Thank you very much .\n\nLauterbrunnen is a village and municipality in the administrative district of Interlaken-Oberhasli, in the Swiss canton of Bern. It is situated between gigantic rock faces and mountain tops, in one of the most spectacular trough valleys in the Alps. With its 72 thundering waterfalls, secluded valleys, colorful alpine meadows, and lonely mountain inns, the Lauterbrunnen Valley is one amongst the largest nature conservation areas in Switzerland.\n\nThe Lauterbrunnen Valley includes 72 waterfalls, the most prominent of which is the Staubbach Falls. They are one of the largest free-falling waterfalls in Europe and plunge nearly 300 meters from an overhanging rock face. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited the valley in 1779 and was inspired to compose his well-known poem \u2018Spirit song over the waters\u2019 by the roaring waters. In any case, as Lauterbrunnen\u2019s notoriety developed and with the culmination of a street from Interlaken in 1834 and the 1890 Bernese Oberland Railway, more inns were required for vacationers. As new lodgings were fabricated, another traveler foundation was additionally underlying the town. They constructed streetcars to M\u00fcrren in 1891 and to Wengen in 1893.\n\nGrindelwald, the village on the Eiger in the Bernese Oberland, is nestled in a lovely green valley surrounded by towering peaks, such as the Eiger North Face and the Wetterhorn. This grandiose panorama as well as the countless viewpoints and activities on offer make Grindelwald one of the most popular and cosmopolitan tourist destinations in Switzerland and the largest ski area in the Jungfrau region.\n\nThanks to the majestic panorama and the glacier which once descended into the valley, Grindelwald attracted its first visitors, mainly English, from the end of the 18th century. In the middle of the 19th century mountaineering began to become popular and local mountain guides climbed the peaks of the region with English tourists. The first ascent of the Eiger, reputed to be very difficult, took place in 1858 (the north wall only in 1938).\n\nWith the construction of roads and railway lines at the end of the 19th century, access to Grindelwald became easier and saw the expansion of winter tourism. The first cable car in the Alps was born here in 1908 at the Wetterhorn. And in 1912, the railway arrived at the Jungfraujoch via the Little Scheidegg; Even today, the \u201cTop of Europe\u201d is Europe\u2019s highest railway station and a world-famous eternal snow and ice excursion destination.\n\n#lauterbrunnen #grindelwald #switzerland #travel #swissbeauty #swissalps",

It's everywhere. In the streets, cellars, barns, on window sills, and even in the communal bread oven. They have been keeping this village alive for almost 500 years during the month of December. Come, we\u2019ll take you to experience a little Christmas magic!\n\nIt\u2019s been a ritual for 25 years now. At Christmas time, thousands of small clay figures appear throughout the village. Shepherds, water carriers, lumberjacks, farmers, millers and bakers are busy in their miniature Proven\u00e7al villages. And tens of thousands of visitors make their way to Luc\u00e9ram to visit them.\n\nIt is around Sainte-Barbe, at the beginning of December, that hundreds of small villages and their figurines take place in the village. This highly anticipated event in the region is organized by members of the \u201cAssociation Maison de Pays de Luc\u00e9ram et du Haut Paillon\u201d and the inhabitants of the village.\n\nThe Luc\u00e9ram mangers are an unmissable event in the region.\nIt all started at Christmas 1996, when Christiane Ricord, president of the Maison de Pays, decided to install a giant nativity scene in the Saint Pierre chapel. This Proven\u00e7al nativity scene is very special because it reproduces the village very precisely and includes around a hundred figurines. Following an article in the local newspaper, thousands of visitors come to Luc\u00e9ram to see this cr\u00e8che.\n\nThe following year, residents followed suit and created their own nativity scenes in front of their homes. The ritual was launched and the first \u201ccr\u00e8che circuit\u201d was inaugurated in 1998. The phenomenon is growing more and more. From 33 nurseries at the start, we increased to 500 around twenty years later. And there's something for everyone. The largest measures more than 10 m long!\n\nBut the village has other tricks up its sleeve. It also has a typically Nice charm that is appreciable in all seasons.\n\nStroll through the village, and lose yourself in the network of staircase streets along which you discover beautiful restored residences. They were built in the gray stone of the country, made to withstand the ravages of time.\n\nThis small medieval town still has a small heritage which bears witness to its prosperous past. Not much remains of its old castle. Just a few ruins and a crenellated tower pierced with archers dating from the 12th and 13th centuries. On the other hand, you can visit the Saintes-Marguerite-et-Rosalie church (built in 1487 and remodeled in 1763) and its altarpiece by Louis Br\u00e9a dating from 1510.\n\nDear friend,\n\nMay the coming year be full of beautiful moments, meet lots of wonderful people and have adventures that fill your heart with joy. To have love, friendship and support from loved ones.\n\nI wish you a New Year full of optimism, success and unforgettable memories. May all your wishes come true, and may every day bring you reasons to smile. Be surrounded by positive energy and feel the warmth of friendship wherever you are.\n\nHappy new year and let's have a wonderful year !\n\nDearfully,\nSebastian\n\n\n\n#christmas #france #village #christmastree",

The principality's automobile registration plates bear the words \"MC\" recalling Monte-Carlo even though it is an abbreviation of Monaco. RMC (Radio Monte-Carlo) bears the name of the district and not that of the country. For car racing, there is the Monaco Grand Prix and the Monte-Carlo Rally.\n\nAt the end of the year, the magic is there and the legend of the holidays meets that of Monte-Carlo! From December to January, stroll through Monaco's Christmas markets, admire the grandiose decorations that adorn the facades and streets, and be amazed by the sparkling illuminations. When the spirit of Christmas invades the Principality, the magic is there. From legendary squares to sumptuous hotels, discover the places in Monaco where you can spend end-of-year celebrations full of magic.\n\nChristmas snow globes | Casino Square\nFrom December 7, marvel at the Place du Casino and let yourself be tempted by \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d. This year, discover the giant snow globes which illustrate the mythical scenes from Charles Dickens' magical story. A walk that evokes the spirit of generosity, kindness and Christmas. The perfect time to experience unforgettable moments with friends or family!\n\nFestive lighting: The streets and buildings of Monaco are beautifully decorated with sparkling lights and festive decorations. The Prince's Palace and other important sights are spectacularly illuminated, creating a fairytale atmosphere.\n\nChristmas Markets: Various locations in Monaco host Christmas markets where locals and tourists alike can enjoy the festive atmosphere. Fairs can offer a variety of handicrafts, Christmas decorations, traditional toys and seasonal culinary delights.\n\nConcerts and cultural events: Around the holidays, concerts and cultural events are often organized to mark the spirit of Christmas. These may include carol performances, theatrical performances or concerts of traditional seasonal music.\n\nCharitable spirit: As in other parts of the world, Christmas in Monaco can also be a time when the community gets involved in charitable activities. Non-profit organizations and local communities can organize events to support those in need during the holidays.\n\nOverall, Christmas in Monaco is an elegant and glamorous experience, where luxury and tradition meet to create an unforgettable festive atmosphere. For up-to-date information on events in 2023, I recommend consulting local sources or checking the official websites of Monaco's tourism authorities.\n\n\ud83c\udf84 Dear wonderful friends,\n\nAt this magical time of the year, I send you my warmest Christmas wishes! \ud83c\udf1f With gratitude for your continued support, I wish you holidays full of joy, love and happiness with your loved ones.\n\nMay this holiday bring you memorable moments, and may the new year be full of achievements, inspiration, peace and new achievements! \ud83c\udf81\n\nThanks for sticking with me and being part of our wonderful community!\n\nWith much love and respect, Sebastian \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n\n\n#christmas #monaco #france #christmastree",

It was in competition with twelve other exceptional municipalities.\n\nThe authentic Kaysersberg Christmas Market is one of the most beautiful Christmas markets in France and Alsace.\n\nThe Kaysersberg Christmas market\nThe Kaysersberg Christmas market is open the 4 weekends of Advent, i.e. the 4 Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays before Christmas, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nChristmas is Alsatians' favorite time of year. The Kaysersbergeois, inhabitants of the medieval town of Kaysersberg, decorate their windows with fir garlands, the town becomes imperial and lights up as soon as night falls.

In Kaysersberg, emotions and discoveries accompany your stroll. Intimate, the Christmas market perpetuates the customs of Advent and invites you on an enchanting journey, in the purest spirit of Christmas.\n\nHistory of Kaysersberg:\nDue to its strategic position which allows control of transit between Haute Alsace and Lorraine (via the Col du Bonhomme), the Kaysersberg valley has been occupied by soldiers since Roman times. At the beginning of the 13th century (around 1218), the fortress was built. It is the beginning of the prosperous period of the city, under the control of the Hohenstaufen family. Kaysersberg became imperial city of the Holy Empire in 1293.\n\nChristmas is about family reunions and reuniting with dear friends. It is the ideal time to appreciate the love in our lives, which we often think we deserve. May these winter holidays fill your heart with love and blessing.Enjoy all the precious moments you spend with friends and family and feel blessed for all the beautiful things you have! Merry Christmas! With love and respect Sebastian \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n\n#christmas #Kaysersberg #alsace #france #travel #beautifulvillage",

It takes place every year, during the Advent period, from November 24 to Christmas Eve, December 24. Its success is largely due to the typical and preserved fortified medieval Alsatian setting, a picturesque hotspot for Alsatian tourism.\n\nA magical ambience in Riquewihr\nIn typically Alsatian style, Riquewihr wonderfully combines the spirit of Christmas with the beauty of its architecture.\n\nDuring the festivities, the magic is all around! The half-timbered fa\u00e7ades are decked out with the finest decorations, the window boxes that overflow with flowers in the summer give way to pretty festive ornaments and a myriad of lights are strung over the village streets and alleyways. A sight for sore eyes that plunges you straight into a fairytale atmosphere!\n\nA veritable world of wonder, the Christmas market comes alive with booth and stall holders plying their wares. You can stroll from chalet to chalet, constantly discovering new treasures among the handicrafts and stopping off on multiple occasions to try the goodies on offer.\n\nDelicious smells and the aroma of Christmas are guaranteed to whet the appetite. Among the treats on offer, you\u2019ll be able to indulge in spice bread, bretzels, all kinds of confectionery and traditional hot chestnuts. Now, there\u2019s a treat that will take you back to your childhood!\n\nHistory of RIQUEWIHR\nCertainly already occupied by the Romans, the site was exploited in the 6th century by a Frankish owner named \"Richo\". His name, associated with that of his domain, \"Richovilla\", is at the origin of the name \"Richovilare\", which has become \"Riquewihr\" over the centuries. Unable to maintain his land on his own, he hired helpers who built houses and thus became the first inhabitants of Riquewihr.\n\n\"Richovilare\", with the surrounding villages, belonged to the counts of Horbourg in the 12th century. The site of Riquewihr was then dominated by a fortified castle, the \"Reichenstein\": subsequently became a haunt of brigand knights, this castle was destroyed in 1269 under the leadership of Rodolphe de Habsbourg who, a few years later, was raised to head of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nWith calm returned, Riquewihr experienced substantial demographic and economic growth thanks to the development of its vineyards. In order to protect men and property, the Count of Horbourg had the town surrounded by walls and ditches in 1291: from then on, Riquewihr was raised to the rank of town, enjoying a certain notoriety in the region. From this period, there remain important vestiges (the Reichenstein keep in the Sembach valley, the northern and western enclosure wall, etc.) and the emblematic witnesses that have become the first monuments of the city, the tower-belfry of Dolder and the Tower of Thieves. \n\n\nMerry Christmas everyone ! I wish you peace and love, Happy Holidays with your loved ones, Take advantage of the Magic of Christmas, for me it is the most beautiful holiday of the year, very exciting for me, thank you for everything, we will see you soon, with much respect and love, Sebastian \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n\n#christmas #france #riquewihr #alsace",

It takes place every year and begins on the first weekend of Advent and ends on December 30 or 31. Its significant success is largely due to its picturesque, typical and preserved medieval Alsatian setting, a hotspot for international Alsatian tourism.\n\nHistory :\nColmar perpetuates the Alsatian tradition of the Christkindelsm\u00e4rik founded in 1570 in Strasbourg1 (Germanic Christian Christmas market of Saint-Nicolas, traditional of Alsatian and German cultures, or market of the Child Jesus in Alsatian).\n\nChristmas traditions, celebrated in Alsace from Advent to Epiphany, take on a special dimension in Colmar...\n\nThe magic of Christmas in Colmar is first and foremost the atmosphere of the Old Town, illuminated and decorated like a fairy tale: a historic setting made magical by the Christmas lights which, during this festive period, blend harmoniously with the exceptional lighting designed to enhance the heritage, and which adorns the center of Colmar with a soft aura of light.\n\nThe city center, essentially pedestrian, conceals innumerable architectural treasures among which monuments, churches, museums and even the alleys, built, for the most imposing, from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. Above all, be sure to marvel at the Pfister house, the Ko\u00effhus, the Unterlinden museum, Little Venice, the Maison des T\u00eates or the Saint-Martin Collegiate Church.\n\nThe whole city is decorated as if in a dream, to make the old center a magical place sheltering the warm atmosphere of Christmas in the heart of the city.\n\nEvery year, Colmarians play a leading role by taking part in a joyful decoration competition which sees them compete in imagination to adorn the facades of houses and shop windows.\n\nI wish you all the best to you and your families, a Merry Christmas with your loved ones, a better new year than the one that passed and may everything you wish come true, be blessed, Merry Christmas!!!

The streets are adorned with their finest finery, the windows sparkle, the smells of cinnamon and spices evoke childhood memories, Christmas carols resound in the depths of the churches. The whole city is transformed into an enchanting setting\n\nChristmas, like nowhere else...\nFor more than a month, Strasbourg is enveloped in a festive and spiritual spirit that has hardly any equivalent in Europe.\n\nStrasbourg, capital of Christmas enjoys an exceptional reputation. Each year, nearly two million visitors flock to the Alsatian capital to discover its wonders.\n\nThe Strasbourg Christmas Market extends over more than ten sites, all located within the Big Island.\n\nDuring the four weeks of the Strasbourg Christmas market, as soon as night falls, the city is adorned with sublime illuminations that give it a magical dimension. The big fir tree, place Kl\u00e9ber, is the most beautiful expression of this. Thirty meters high, wonderfully decorated, it impresses with its presence, its majesty. Symbol of an Alsatian tradition dating back five centuries, it is the ambassador of a city bathed in light.\n\nThe Christkindelsm\u00e4rik, or \"market of the child Jesus\", is the name given in the Alsatian language to the traditional Christmas market which has been held since 1570 in Strasbourg, Alsace, and was for a long time the only one in France. It begins on the first Saturday of Advent and ends on the evening of December 24. The Christkindelsm\u00e4rik attracts two million visitors from all over the world every year.\n\nThe origins :\n\nChristmas Eve in Alsace - Christkindel and Hans Trapp coming to ask if the children have been good. (Theophile Schuler 1858)\nThe Christkindelsm\u00e4rik in Strasbourg is one of the oldest Christmas markets, which were specific to the Germanic world. The most famous was that of Nuremberg, but those of Frankfurt, Dresden and Berlin were also very famous. In the Middle Ages, a market was organized in Strasbourg in anticipation of the feast of Saint Nicolas on December 6. It is indeed to this saint, bishop of Myra in Turkey in the 4th century, that the role of giver of gifts to children was attributed. To allow parents to obtain sweets and toys, a market, called in Alsatian \u201cKlausem\u00e4rik\u201d, was then set up a few days before this date.\n\n\n#strasbourg #france #christmas #alsace #travel",

Before even landing on the tarmac in Nice, you will be breathless by the spectacle that awaits you through the window. It is not surprising that Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur International Airport has been, for several years in a row, on the podium of the most beautiful approaches in the world! In addition to the extraordinary shades of the Mediterranean Sea, the panorama of the mountains (snow-capped in winter) also arouses wonder.\n\nCapital of the C\u00f4te d'Azur, Nice perfectly embodies the sweetness and the art of living. Blue of the Mediterranean, marvelous light that can only be found here, breakfast on a sunny terrace, calm of a walk in the alleys of the old town, lunch on the terrace of a hotel, afternoon shopping in the city's prestigious boutiques, a dip in the sea, an aperitif on the Cours Saleya, a classical music concert at the Opera, a gala evening at the Casino, a candlelight dinner in a starred restaurant...Nice is all this and more!\n\nThe recent inclusion of Nice in UNESCO is recognition of the exceptional universal value of the architectural, landscape and urban heritage of Nice, a fusion of international cultural influences. A veritable open-air museum, Nice offers you its extraordinary Belle \u00c9poque, Art Deco and Baroque architectural heritage. Or even modern. Just look up and let yourself be surprised by so much diversity and refinement.\n\nA popular destination for tourists from all over the world, the capital of the C\u00f4te d'Azur nestles between the Big Blue and the surrounding mountains, sometimes draped in white, sometimes carpeted in intense green.\n\nAlong the sea is the famous Promenade des Anglais, a prestigious avenue where palm trees line pretty Haussmann houses and sumptuous Belle \u00c9poque hotels, such as the Negresco or the Westminster. We settle on one of the many terraces facing the immense azure expanse of the Mediterranean or directly on its pebble beaches forming a shades of gray and blue. The most athletic will benefit from the road laid out for cyclists or rollerbladers.\n\nPush your way to explore the secular heritage of the one nicknamed \"Nissa la bella\". In the heart of Old Nice, wander between the winding streets with colorful houses that make this timeless place so charming and discover Baroque buildings and churches such as the Ges\u00f9 church, the Lascaris palace or the Sainte-R\u00e9parate cathedral. Stroll between the light ocher facades with turquoise shutters revealing authentic Proven\u00e7al dwellings. It is highly recommended that you accompany this escape with a Ni\u00e7oise ice cream whose striking flavors have nothing to envy to those of its Italian neighbour! Take advantage of this walk to discover local specialties. The district is home to small traditional shops showcasing the jewels of Provence: lavender, spices, herbs, scented candles... their scents mingle with those of socca, an amazing corn cake whose reputation extends beyond the borders. Also not to be missed is the famous Cours Saleya, where florists, fruit and vegetable merchants and local producers proudly unveil their stalls forming an incredible palette of colours. On Mondays, this place is reserved for second-hand goods dealers. Notice to amateurs! In the evening, the Cours Saleya comes alive with its many restaurants, bars and caf\u00e9 terraces.\n\n#Nice #france #travel #frenchtown #Beautifulcity #mediterraneancity #beautiful",

With its 72 roaring waterfalls as well as secluded valleys, flower-filled alpine pastures and secluded mountain hotels, the Lauterbrunnen Valley is one of Switzerland's most important nature reserves.\n\n\"Lauter Brunnen\" - the name of the village alone already evokes the singularity of this landscape: the valley of Lauterbrunnen has 72 waterfalls. The most emblematic is the Staubbach waterfall, one of the highest waterfalls in Europe, which flows from a rock wall almost 300 meters high. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who visited the valley in 1779, found inspiration in these roaring waters to compose his famous poem \u201cGesang der Geister \u00fcber den Wassern\u201d.\n\nIn the heart of the \u201cSchwarzer M\u00f6nch\u201d mountain, hidden behind impressive rock walls, the Tr\u00fcmmelbach waterfall offers an equally grandiose natural spectacle. Nearly 20,000 liters of water per second rush along ten waterfalls of glacial origin totaling a height of about 200 meters. You can only attend this show in summer, by taking an elevator in the tunnel.\n\n\nThe village of Lauterbrunnen (795m) is the starting point for the most famous tourist destinations in the Jungfrau region. A rack railway connects Lauterbrunnen to the sunny terrace of Wengen on the eastern flank of the Lauterbrunnen valley and the Kleine Scheidegg, where you change trains to climb the Jungfraujoch.\n\nOn the opposite side is M\u00fcrren, a holiday resort, accessible from Lauterbrunnen or Stechelberg. Departing from Stechelberg, the cable car takes you to the top of the Schilthorn, at an altitude of 2971m, famous for having served as the setting for the filming of a classic from the James Bond 007 series: \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" .\n\nLauterbrunnen has a population on 31 December 2010 of 2,558. In 2007, 19.2% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the past 10 years, the population has declined at a rate of -14.3%. Most of the population in 2000 spoke German (85.2%), Portuguese being the most frequent (4.9%) and Serbo-Croatian being third (2.0%).\n\nBase jumping :\n\nLauterbrunnen Cliffs.\nLauterbrunnen is an important site for base jumping and wingsuiting, several fatal accidents are recorded each year.\n\nIn Lauterbrunnen, there are 20,000 jumps per year; thirty-three times deaths of people practicing this sport have been recorded since 1994\n\nIn the Forza Motorsport series, Lauterbrunnen is the host city of the fictional Bernese Alps circuit.\n\n\n#lauterbrunnen #wengen #Switzerland #travel #swissvillage #swiss #BeautifulVillage #swissbeauty",

They have seconds to plan and 30 minutes to cook an amazing course with the basket of mystery ingredients given to them moments before the clock starts ticking! Chopped is a game of passion, expertise and skill \u2014 and in the end, only one chef will survive the Chopping Block. \n\nWelcome to Food Network, where learning to cook is as simple as clicking play!

Cook over medium heat until bright green, about 3 minutes. Remove to a plate and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n\nAdd the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet and another drizzle of olive oil. Add the mushrooms and cook until they have lost their moisture and browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and green onions. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir to combine. Stir in the thyme followed by the chives, then add the rice and stir until it is well coated in the butter and mushrooms. Add the broth and stir. Bring to a simmer, then cover and transfer to the oven. Bake until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, 35 to 45 minutes.\n\nCarefully remove from the oven and remove the lid. Add 3 ounces of the goat cheese and all but 1/4 cup of the reserved asparagus, then stir until creamy. Top with the remaining ounce goat cheese, the asparagus, arugula, red onion, torn basil leaves and lemon zest.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\nRee Drummond's Mushrooms and Asparagus Oven Risotto | The Pioneer Woman | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/1WSKhlFoi30",

Slice the mushroom caps about 1/4-inch thick. Heat 6 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet; add the mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Saute over medium heat, stirring frequently, until they are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the mushrooms, radicchio, cream, cheeses, sage, and remaining salt.\n\nParboil the pasta shells for 4 minutes; drain and add to the ingredients in the mixing bowl. Toss to combine.\n\nDivide the pasta mixture among 6 to 8 individual, shallow, ceramic gratin dishes (1 1/2 to 2 cup capacity). Dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and bake until bubbly and brown on top, about 7 to 10 minutes.\n\nCook\u2019s Note\n\nIn the absence of fresh sage, do not substitute dried. As a substitute, choose one of the following: 1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh tarragon OR 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves OR 8 leaves fresh rosemary OR 1/4 teaspoon fennel seed You may garnish with fresh Italian parsley, but do not cook the parsley in the pasta.\n\nCopyright 2010, Johanne Killeen, All Rights Reserved\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25ba WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com  \n\u25ba STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25ba FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25ba INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25ba TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork \n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork \n\nIna Garten Makes Conchiglie al Forno with Mushrooms & Radicchio | Barefoot Contessa | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/ULzUFzdZZKo",

We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nSpicy Braised Chicken\nRECIPE COURTESY OF SUNNY ANDERSON\nLevel: Easy\nTotal: 4 hr 20 min\nPrep: 30 min\nInactive: 1 hr 45 min\nCook: 2 hr 5 min\nYield: 4 servings\n\nIngredients\n\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n8 pieces chicken (2 breasts cut in half, 2 thighs, 2 legs), skin removed\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 onion, cut into chunks\n2 celery stalks, cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 Granny Smith apple, peeled and cut into 8 wedges\n1 habanero chile\n2 cloves garlic, smashed\n2 dry bay leaves\n12 sprigs fresh thyme, tied into a bundle\n1 cup dry white wine\n1 1/2 cups chicken stock\n1 tablespoon concentrated gravy sauce (recommended: Gravy Master)\n\nFor the Brown Gravy:\n1 tablespoon butter\n1 tablespoon olive oil\nChicken giblets\n1/2 cup diced onion\n4 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n2 cups chicken stock\nCoconut Rice n' Peas, recipe follows\n\nCoconut Rice n' Peas:\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 medium onion, chopped\n1 teaspoon salt\n2 cups long-grain rice\n1/2 cup coconut milk\n1 (12-ounce) can pigeon peas, drained and rinsed\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\nDirections\n\nPreheat a 7 1/4-quart Dutch oven on medium-high heat, then melt butter and add oil. Season chicken generously with salt and pepper and sear until golden on both sides, about 8 minutes. Remove from pot and set aside. Add carrots, onion, celery, and apple, the whole habanero, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper and saute until they start to soften, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add wine and let reduce by half, scraping up any brown bits remaining on the bottom of the pot. Nestle chicken into pot and add enough broth to almost cover the chicken, about 1 1/2 cups and the gravy sauce. Cover and simmer for 1 hour 45 minutes or until chicken falls off the bone. In the last half hour, remove the lid and let liquid reduce.\n\nTo make the gravy: In a medium saucepan, melt butter with oil over medium high-heat. Add giblets and brown on all sides, about 6 minutes. Add onion and continue cooking another 5 minutes, until onions start to soften. Add flour and stir, cooking another 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in the stock. Bring to a simmer and strain. Discard giblets and put gravy back in the pot. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm on the stove and add to braised chicken once it's cooked.\n\nServe Braised Chicken over Coconut Rice n' Peas\n\nCoconut Rice n' Peas:\n\nHeat olive oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and salt and saute, until onion becomes translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add rice and saute another 2 minutes to toast rice. Add coconut milk and fill saucepan with enough water to cover the rice by 1/2-inch or measure by placing your thumb tip on the rice and filling the pot with water until the water reaches the middle of your thumbnail. Bring rice to a simmer, cover and cook until rice is tender and liquid has evaporated, about 15 to 17 minutes.\nRemove from heat and let rice stand another 5 minutes, covered. Fluff rice with fork and then fold in pigeon peas. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.\nYield: 4 to 6 servings\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\nSunny Anderson's Spicy Braised Caribbean Chicken | Cooking For Real | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/-avXUKNFqsY",

Combine the flour and BBQ rub in a shallow dish.\n\nHeat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.\n\nDredge the pork chops in the flour mixture, then add them to the skillet. Cook the first side until well browned, 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side, an additional 2 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.\n\nAdd the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet with the potatoes, cut sides down. Scatter the onions, garlic and rosemary over the skillet and cook, undisturbed, until the potatoes are deep golden, 2 to 4 minutes. Shake the skillet, releasing the potatoes, then stir. Deglaze the skillet with the apple cider, scraping the skillet. Add the chicken stock and balsamic glaze and bring to a boil. Cook until the sauce has reduced by about half and the potatoes are tender, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\nRemove from the heat and stir in the spinach and cream. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Add the pork chops back to the skillet, then garnish with the parsley and serve.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\nRee Drummond's Apple Cider Pork Chops | The Pioneer Woman | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/CiVp_3DwNVE",

We'll give you a behind-the-scenes look at our best shows, take you inside our favorite restaurant and be your resource in the kitchen to make sure every meal is a 10/10!\n\nLobster Scampi and Daikon Spaghetti\nRecipe courtesy of Michael Voltaggio\nLevel: Intermediate\nTotal: 1 hr\nActive: 30 min\nYield: 1 to 2 servings\n\nIngredients\n\nPanko Topping:\n1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into pieces\n1 clove garlic, crushed\n1 cup panko breadcrumbs\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nLobster and Daikon:\n1 quart lobster or shellfish stock\n1 Maine lobster tail\n1/2 large daikon radish\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tablespoon Calabrian chile paste\n1/4 cup white wine\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold\n1 lemon cheek (from 1 lemon; see Cook\u2019s Note)\n1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped\n\nDirections\n\nSpecial equipment: a vegetable sheeter\n\nFor the panko topping: Add the butter and garlic to a pan and cook over medium-low heat until the butter melts and bubbles, the bubbles subside and the butter turns brown and smells nutty, about 2 minutes. Add the panko and cook until toasted and golden, another 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Drain the crumbs, reserving the brown butter. Transfer the crumbs to a paper towel-lined plate to dry.\n\nFor the lobster and daikon: Simmer the shellfish or lobster stock in a saucepan until reduced to about 1 cup, 35 to 40 minutes. Keep warm on the stove.\n\nBring a pot of water to a boil. Insert a skewer lengthwise through the meat of the lobster tail (keeping the shell on). Blanch the lobster tail in the boiling water until the shell is red and the meat is almost cooked, about 6 minutes. Let cool, then remove the meat from the shell and cut in half lengthwise into 2 pieces that resemble large shrimp; reserve.\n\nPut the daikon through a vegetable sheeter. Fold the long sheet of daikon over itself to create 10- to 12-inch folds, cut the edges off (that have the peel) and then cut into spaghetti-size noodles.\n\nHeat a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium and add 2 tablespoons of the reserved brown butter. Add the lobster and garlic to the pan and sear the lobster for 2 minutes. Add the Calabrian chile and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes. Deglaze with the white wine and scrape up any flavor bits. Add the daikon noodles and 1/2 cup of the reduced stock and season with salt and pepper. Cook until just warmed through, about another 2 minutes. Finish with the butter, a squeeze of the lemon cheek and a sprinkle of chopped parsley. Plate and top with the brown butter panko.\n\nCook\u2019s Note\nTo cut lemon cheeks, stand a lemon vertically on a cutting board. Cut down one side from top to bottom, avoiding the core and seeds, to make a \u201ccheek\u201d (like you would with an apple to avoid the core). Repeat with a second side (you can get 4 cheeks from 1 lemon).\n\nCopyright 2024 Television Food Network, G.P.

Butter the inside of a 6 to 8-cup souffle dish (6 1/2 to 7 1/2 inches in diameter by 3 1/2 inches deep) and sprinkle evenly with Parmesan.\n\nMelt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. With a wooden spoon, stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Off the heat, whisk in the hot milk, the nutmeg, cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook over low heat, whisking constantly, for 1 minute, until smooth and thick.\n\nOff the heat, while still hot, whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time. Stir in the Cheddar, 1/4 cup of Parmesan and the spinach and transfer to a large mixing bowl.\n\nPut the egg whites, cream of tartar, and a pinch of salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on low speed for 1 minute, on medium speed for 1 minute, then finally on high speed until they form firm, glossy peaks.\n\nWhisk one quarter of the egg whites into the cheese sauce to lighten and then fold in the rest. Pour into the souffle dish, then smooth the top. Draw a large circle on top with the spatula to help the souffle rise evenly, and place in the middle of the oven. Turn the temperature down to 375 degrees F. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes (don't peek!) until puffed and brown. Serve immediately.\n\nCopyright 2010 by Ina Garten.

If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat.\n\nPlace a Dutch oven over the direct heat side of the grill to heat up. Add the olive oil. Add the ground beef, beef heart and salt and pepper to the pan with the olive oil and brown for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onion, bell pepper and garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute. Add the ground chipotle, paprika, ground cumin, oregano and cloves and let the spices bloom in the fat for 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and flour and stir with a wooden spoon until a smooth paste forms. Add the broth and stir, scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pan.\n\nBring to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered and with the grill cover up, until the chili is nice and thick and the flavors come together, about 1 hour.\nGrill the hot dogs over direct heat until the casings are crisp, 5 minutes or so. Place the buns on the indirect-heat side of the grill to warm. Place the hot dogs in the buns and top with chili, a line of yellow mustard and diced onion.\n\nCook\u2019s Note\nIf you can\u2019t find or don\u2019t want to use ground beef heart, you can use all ground beef \u2014 but it won\u2019t be an authentic Coney dog.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\nMichael Symon's Coney Dogs | Symon's Dinners Cooking Out | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/KAofYhGcy-s",

Using a meat mallet, flatten until they are 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper, then set aside.\n\nAdd the flour, ancho chile powder, garlic powder, onion powder and a pinch each of salt and pepper to a shallow dish, then stir to combine. Add the eggs and milk to a second shallow dish and whisk to combine. Bread the steaks by dredging them in the flour mix, then dipping them into the egg mixture, coating both sides. Place them back into the flour mixture, turning to fully coat. Set aside on a clean plate.\n\nHeat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the oil is hot and the butter has melted. Add the steaks and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the steaks and drain all but 1/3 cup of the grease. Add all the peppers and cook until the edges begin to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a clean plate and set aside.\n\nFor the gravy: Sprinkle the flour over the remaining grease in the skillet and whisk to combine. Stir and cook until the roux is golden in color, 2 to 3 minutes. While whisking, slowly add the milk and ancho chile powder. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and continue to stir until thick and smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.\n\nServe the steaks with the biscuits, lightly covered with some of the gravy. Sprinkle over the peppers and serve with the remaining gravy on the side.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\nRee Drummond's Tex-Mex Chicken-Fried Steak | The Pioneer Woman | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/Lbm7NpHWTeE",

Add the tomatillos, garlic cloves, ancho chile, poblano chile and onion. Char on all sides until blackened in parts, then remove as charred to a cutting board. (Depending on their size, each vegetable or chile will char at a different rate.)\n\nPlace the charred ancho chile in a small bowl and pour over enough hot water to cover. Allow to sit until the chile is softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the stem and seeds and reserve the water to adjust the consistency of your salsa, if needed.\n\nRemove the stem and seeds from the poblano and the skins from the garlic and onion.\n\nPut the ancho, poblano, garlic, onion, tomatillos, cilantro, agave, tomatoes and lime juice in a food processor and blend until mostly smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\nFor the burrito: Coat the steak in the adobo seasoning. If you have the time and inclination, place the seasoned steak on a wire rack set in a sheet pan in the fridge overnight to ensure a super charred crust!\nHeat a well-oiled grill or grill pan on high heat.\n\nGrill the steak until super charred, 7 to 8 minutes per side. Let the steak rest on a plate for at least 10 minutes or up to 30. Chop the steak into small pieces. Mix back in any accumulated juices and season to taste with more adobo if necessary.\n\nIn a tortilla, schmear sour cream in an even layer from end to end. On top of the sour cream, \u201cglue down\u201d an even, end-to-end layer of iceberg, then an even layer of diced tomatoes, then a thin layer of avocado followed by a final layer of cheese.\n\nPlace some chopped skirt steak on top of cheese and roll up the burrito.\nPlace the burrito on a flat griddle drizzled with oil over medium heat until at least two sides are slightly golden. Repeat to make 3 more burritos.\nServe with the salsa verde and fire-roasted red salsa.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to fill up on the latest must-eat recipes, brilliant kitchen hacks and content from your favorite Food Network shows.\n\u25b6 WEBSITE: https://www.foodnetwork.com\n\u25b6 STREAM ON MAX: https://foodtv.com/StreamOnMaxYT\n\u25b6 FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/FoodNetwork\n\u25b6 TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork\n\u25b6 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/FoodNetwork\n\nJeff Mauro's Chicago-Style Steak Burrito | The Kitchen | Food Network\nhttps://youtu.be/iIgyNSt9jjM",

On a plate, place salt and pepper. Dredge chops in seasoning. In a medium skillet over medium heat, saute the bacon, chopped onions, thyme, and sage until the bacon is almost crispy and the onions are beginning to caramelize around the edges, about 10 minutes. Pour mixture into a bowl. Add apples, butter, 2 tablespoons of pineapple-orange juice and cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper. Stuff each chop with apple mixture and hold together with skewers. In same skillet over medium-high heat, add enough oil to coat the pan and sear both sides of the chops until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Add 1 cup pineapple-orange juice and remaining onion wedges around the chops. Season with salt and pepper and bake until cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chops, basting 2 to 3 times. Remove pork chops from pan and let rest 10 minutes. Add remaining pineapple-orange juice and scrape up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add lemon zest and parsley.

        "video_description": "Welcome to our special episode celebrating Novruz, the national holiday of Azerbaijan! In this video, you'll see us cooking with the U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan, Mark Libby, and his spouse Danusiya, as we join in traditional rituals and customs. Get ready for some festive fun and enjoy the celebration with us! \n\nNovruz is a cherished and significant holiday for the Azerbaijani people, deeply rooted in their culture and history. It marks the arrival of spring on March 20-21, which also signals the beginning of the New Year. Its origins go way back to old customs and rituals connected to spirits, nature worship, and fertility beliefs. Novruz, an ancient spring festival, is one of Azerbaijan's oldest and most beautiful traditions. \n\nNovruz in Azerbaijan has always been about celebrating the rebirth of nature, goodness, and fairness. It's mainly about honoring the Sun and its representation on Earth, Fire. In the month leading to Novruz, every Tuesday is dedicated to celebrating the four elements of nature: water, fire, earth, and air (or wind), with the last one, known as \"Akhir Charshanba,\" signaling the start of spring when leaves start budding. People get busy cleaning their homes, planting trees, making new clothes, painting eggs, and baking traditional pastries like shekarbura, pakhlava, and shorgoghal, along with various national dishes. \n\nAccording to some sources, Novruz has an ancient history dating back 3500-5000 years, related to the time of the prophet Zardush. Novruz is a time for families to come together, enjoy a rich meal the night before the holiday, and welcome the New Year. It's also a time for big gatherings, festivals, and folk music concerts. The celebrations last for several days, ending with lively public dancing and other fun activities.\n\nWilderness - \ud83d\udd2a Our special Knives and Cookware - https://bit.ly/3l7Nkrn\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Make sure that you have the bell turned on, so you will definitely not miss any of our videos!\n \n\ud83c\udf10  Our other profiles:\n     \u25b6  Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/wilderness.cooking/\n     \u25b6  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/wildernesscooking\n\nIf you want to support us: https://www.patreon.com/wildernesscooking\n\n\u2753 ABOUT US:\nWilderness Cooking channel about cooking delicious dishes in the wild.\nWe live in a village and try to find very beautiful places to shoot.\n\n\u23e9 A few ultimate-delicious recipes from my channel:\n     \u25fc Guinea fowl cooking in oven: https://youtu.be/EPumgD3yvsI\n     \u25fc Bull tail stew with chestnut: https://youtu.be/OZfiSGIeasQ\n     \u25fc Chestnut dish with lamb meat: https://youtu.be/k-TqxsLSCmw\n     \u25fc Bull heart dish recipe: https://youtu.be/gbLTabSJJhw\n     \u25fc Liver kebab of lamb: https://youtu.be/kGeljNYSrNU\n     \u25fc Cooking lamb  brains recipe: https://youtu.be/fCUi8doYdNY\n     \u25fc Lamb testicles  kabob: https://youtu.be/IvuzVsct6xM\n     \u25fc How to cook rabbit in the wilderness: https://youtu.be/2k44uYUx8rY\n     \u25fc Vegetables and lamb bbq kebab: https://youtu.be/GpzdzpfXBBc\n     \u25fc The best buglama recipe: https://youtu.be/CaXHmGY9Y4E\n     \u25fc Spicy lamb shish kebabs recipes: https://youtu.be/ElqRSrhqaIQ\n     \u25fc Garlic Grill Lamb Caucasian style: https://youtu.be/nggcoUbK6Ac\n\n#novruz #holiday #village",
